**Objective**

I conducted research during my master's program to investigate the characteristics of radiative heat transfer in porous materials with surface or internal voids. A machine learning model was essential for predicting the radiative properties of porous media, varying with different porous structure, material composition, and types of radiative heat. To accomplish this task, I applied thermodynamic domain knowledge, machine learning optimization techniques, and simulation tools. The research findings can be applied in various engineering fields, such as controlling the production of complex structures in metal 3D printing processes by sintering metal powders with lasers or designing radiation shielding materials.

- Performed Monte Carlo Ray Tracing simulation to approximate radiative properties of porous media
- Prepared training sets for Neural Networks through simulations and data cleaning processes
- Developed Neural Networks surrogate model to predict radiative properties of porous media accurately and efficiently
- Remodeled open-source Fortran code in Linux environment to obtain complex geometry data
- Utilized parallel computing in simulations to improve space and time efficiency
