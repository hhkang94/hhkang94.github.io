**Accomplishments**

- Transformed IMU raw data to 3D trajectory
- Visualized 3D swing trajectory
- Developed swing performance index (tempo, club angle, club face, etc)
- Prototyped classification model to predict a direction of ball flight
- Collected IMU data and tested new version at golf fields
