**Task**

Build swing analyzer based on IMU sensor data (time series) to provide individualized feedback instruction on golf swings taken by an user. 



**Difficulties**

- Noises in sensor data
- Golf swing analysis (domain knowledge) and interpretation (XAI)
- Data problems
- Individualization
- Limited resource of mobile device



**Results**

- Transformed IMU raw data to 3D trajectory
- Visualized 3D swing trajectory
- Developed swing performance index (tempo, club angle, club face, etc)
- Prototyped classification model to predict a direction of ball flight
- Collected data and tested new version at golf fields
