*Programming language : Python*

*Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, etc*

*Database: Firebase (NoSQL)*



**Task**

Build golf swing analyzer based on IMU sensor data (time series) to provide individualized feedback instruction to users. 



**Challenges**

- Noises in sensor data
- Golf swing analysis (domain knowledge) and interpretation (XAI)
- Data problems
- Personalization
- Limited computing resource of mobile device



**Accomplishments**

- Transformed IMU raw data to 3D trajectory
- Visualized 3D swing trajectory
- Developed swing performance index (tempo, club angle, club face, etc)
- Prototyped classification model to predict a direction of ball flight
- Collected IMU data and tested new version at golf fields
