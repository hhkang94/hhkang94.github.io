Fault Detection and Classification (FDC)

##Task

Researched a deep learning (DL) model to classify normal and abnormal case occurred during semiconductor device fabrication process

##Why

The variables in sensor data show various patterns such as spikes, linearity, non-linearity, steps, etc. A DL model is developed to automatically extract these useful patterns from time series data.
